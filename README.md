# DataExpertio â€“ Data Engineering Bootcamp Projects

Welcome to my project repository for the 6-week Data Engineering Bootcamp with Zach. Throughout the program, I worked on and refined several code examples, which Iâ€™ll be sharing here.

## ðŸ“Œ Week 1: PostgreSQL â€“ SCD & Dimensional Modeling

The first weekâ€™s assignments focus on:
- **SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions)** implementation
- **Dimensional data modeling** techniques using PostgreSQL

Wherever possible, Iâ€™ve added inline comments to highlight my own contributions and reasoning behind specific design choices.
